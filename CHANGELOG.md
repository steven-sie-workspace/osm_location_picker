## 1.0.5

- Fix: the map was covered by "API KEY REQUIRED" because CARTO basemaps now need an API key. The map now uses OpenFreeMap vector tiles in the same Positron style, painted on the device by `vector_tile_renderer` (pure Dart, so it also runs on HarmonyOS), sharp up to zoom 18.
- Added the OpenFreeMap / OpenMapTiles / OpenStreetMap attribution on the map.

## 1.0.4

- Fix: added macOS App Sandbox location entitlements and usage description keys to enable GPS location picking.
- Fix: updated GPS fetching to use a 5-second timeout and fallback to the last known position to prevent indefinite hangs.
- Fix: resolved target warnings in Xcode/CocoaPods builds regarding dependency analysis and deployment target versions.
- Updated documentation and README with troubleshooting steps for macOS application run behaviors.

## 1.0.3

- Fix: added required Android permissions (INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, location) for release builds.
- Fix: network connectivity check now works in Android release builds (added network security config).
- Fix: SVG icon assets not loading after package rename (wrong `package:` reference).
- Fix: error message no longer shown as search bar hint text on offline/failure state.
- Added network and location permissions for iOS, macOS, and documentation for all platforms.
- Updated README with comprehensive platform-specific setup instructions.
