/// A self-contained Flutter location picker powered by OpenStreetMap.
///
/// No API key is required. Users can pan/zoom the map, search for addresses,
/// and confirm a location. The package returns a [LocationModel] with the
/// selected address and [LatLng] coordinates.
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```dart
/// final result = await Navigator.of(context).push<LocationModel>(
///   MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => const LocationPickerView()),
/// );
/// ```
